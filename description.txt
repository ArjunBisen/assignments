I looked at house of reps spending on water and listed the offices who spent more than 2831 dollars on water in the 1st quarter of 2017. That is more than one standard deviation above the mean spend on water which was 1825 dollars. The three offices who spent more than 2831 dollars on water were the office of the speaker, the minority leader, and committee on ways and means.
